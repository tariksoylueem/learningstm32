# STM32 Projects – BTK Academy Course

This repository contains all STM32-based embedded systems projects I developed while following the official STM32 course on BTK Akademi. Each project is implemented using STM32CubeMX and STM32CubeIDE.

## 🔧 Tools & Environment
- STM32CubeMX  
- STM32CubeIDE  
- STM32F4 Discovery / Nucleo board  
- C Programming  
- Peripherals: GPIO, UART, Timer, PWM, ADC

## 📁 Project List
| No | Project Name | Description |
|----|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | GPIO LED Blink | Basic digital output using GPIO pin |
| 2 | Button Interrupt | External interrupt with button input |
| 3 | PWM LED Control | LED brightness using PWM signal |
| 4 | UART Communication | Sending and receiving data over UART |
| 5 | ADC Value Read | Reading analog input via potentiometer |
| 6 | UART + ADC + PWM Control | Controlling LED brightness over UART with analog input |
